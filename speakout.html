	<p>The large banner outside the prestigious National Museum of Art in Mexico City reads: "Discursos de la piel." Translation: "Discourses on skin." The accompanying image is that of a mulatta from Mexico's colonial era. When I first saw the banner, my mind automatically added the word "color" after the word "skin." I assume that my mind did that because the topic of skin color in Mexico during that era was very pronounced. That is code for a society that was very racially stratified.</p>
