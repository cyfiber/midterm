<h1>Teachers With Handguns Are No Match for Assault Rifles: Why the Trump-NRA Plan Doesn't Work</h1>

	<p>After the latest gun massacre, students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and throughout the country, are leading a movement that might finally loosen the National Rifle Association's (NRA) chokehold on our government. But to get there, they will have to triumph over an increasingly irrational and inhumane gun lobby, their mercenaries in Congress and the reality-disconnected White House.</p> 
<p>Romanticizing "wild west," Hollywood-style shootouts, Trump is selling the idea that "former marine" tough guys, cut from the mold of White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, would have saved those high school teenagers and are the solution to preventing future school shootings. Apparently, there are hundreds of thousands of these Rambos on an island somewhere, just waiting to teach Shakespeare in our public schools. Predictably, Trump even bragged to the nation that he would have rushed in to confront the shooter himself, even without any gun. Additionally, in tweets and on televised interviews, the president offered this stunning amalgam: 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>"Frankly you have teachers that are marines for 20 years, they retire and become a teacher ... they're people that have won shooting contests ... for whatever."<br>
"It's called concealed carry, where a teacher would have a concealed gun on them. They'd go for special training and they would be there and you would no longer have a gun-free zone. Gun-free zone to a maniac -- because they're all cowards -- a gun-free zone is 'let's go in and let's attack because bullets aren't coming back at us ..."<br>
"We have to harden our schools, not soften them up. A gun-free zone to a killer ... that's like going in for the ice cream."
</p></div>

<p>Trump's responses were a more incoherent version of the exact same language used in a speech given by NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre on the very same day to the Conservative Political Action Conference. His answer to mass shootings is more guns -- and of course, more profit for gun manufacturers.
An entire book could be written on the morbid nonsense of this strategy, but in short: Of 156 mass shootings between 2009 and 2016, only 10 percent occurred in "gun-free" zones. Moreover, many mass shooters intend to commit suicide or go down in a blaze of glory. Armed math teachers would provide no deterrence whatsoever, as handgun-wielding teachers would be badly overmatched by assault rifles.
Of course, all guns can kill, but they are not created equal in their lethal potential. The NRA calls the AR-15 "America's rifle." And that label speaks volumes about the US and about the NRA. It is the weapon of choice for mass shooters, and you can buy one for as little as $500. In Florida, you can buy one more quickly and with less oversight than a handgun. Anyone over 18 with nothing on their record can buy one within minutes of walking into a store, as did the Parkland shooter. Its inventor, Eugene Stoner, designed it specifically to offer an advantage to US troops over enemy troops using the Russian AK-47 in wartime.</p>
<p>Physics and anatomy are not often part of the gun control debate. They are both far beyond the concerns of the NRA or the comprehension of Donald Trump. But the physics behind firearms and the anatomical consequences they create tell perhaps the most important story about whether gun battles are the solution to these exclusively American mass shooters.
The kinetic energy (and therefore destructive potential) of a bullet is equal to one- half of the mass of the bullet, times its velocity squared. Bullets come of out of an AR-15 at 3,300 feet per second, three times the velocity of the average Glock pistol, producing kinetic energy 10 times greater than bullets from a handgun. Furthermore, AR-15 bullets "tumble" as they penetrate flesh, widening the area of tissue damage. Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona, compares the damage from a handgun bullet to the AR-15 this way: "One looks like a grenade went off in there. The other looks like a bad knife cut."</p>
<p>Unless it hits the heart or a major blood vessel, a bullet from a handgun creates tissue damage confined to roughly the diameter of the bullet. The injuries are usually non-fatal, and the bullets are often stopped by bones or lodged in tissue. But the high-velocity, high-energy bullets from an AR-15 are specifically designed to cause massive collateral damage in the human body, leaving a much wider path of destruction, utterly destroying organs rather than simply putting a hole through them. Despite its rather small size, an AR-15 bullet can literally obliterate three inches of the largest bone in your body, the femur. Likewise, it can shred a major artery several inches away from the point of impact. One bullet can turn the largest organs in your body, your liver and your brain, into mush. The exit wound can be as large as an orange. Most victims that die from AR-15 bullet wounds bleed to death on the spot, with no chance for survival.
Trump and every politician that takes money from the NRA should be forced to come into the operating room with me and look at what is left of an innocent child or teenager when their body has been riddled with bullets from an assault rifle. If a victim is "lucky" and survives, removing the dead tissue created by an AR-15 bullet will require a series of multiple, sequential operations. Survivors are often left debilitated, with impaired organ function, and require more surgeries throughout their lifetime. They are often relegated to a life of chronic pain and permanent disfigurement.</p>
